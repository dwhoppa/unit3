**Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?**

One of the proudest moments for me during this project was when I encountered a critical mistake in my code about halfway through development. Without fixing this issue, I couldn't proceed further, and it took me nearly four hours of debugging, testing different approaches, and carefully analyzing my code to finally identify and resolve the problem. The moment I fixed it and saw my program running correctly was incredibly rewarding. It made me realize how much patience and persistence matter in coding, and it gave me a huge sense of accomplishment.

**Q2. What worked well this time?**

This time, one of the biggest improvements in my CS project was how quickly I completed the documentation. Usually, this part of the process takes me a long time, but I was able to organize my thoughts more efficiently and document my work much faster than before. This helped me keep track of my progress more effectively and made the overall development process smoother.

**Q3. What will you do differently for unit 4/IA?**

For Unit 4 and my IA, I plan to focus more on improving my time management. In this project, I realized that I sometimes spent too much time on certain tasks, like debugging, without a clear plan, which slowed down my overall progress. Moving forward, I want to set more structured deadlines for each stage of development and stick to a schedule. I will also break tasks into smaller steps and allocate specific time blocks for coding, debugging, and documentation to ensure I don’t fall behind. This approach will help me work more efficiently and avoid last-minute stress.

**Q4. What do you need help with?**

One area where I need help is improving my understanding of fundamental coding concepts. I sometimes struggle with basic elements, which makes it difficult to move forward with more complex parts of the project. When I encounter errors, I often spend a lot of time trying to figure out the problem, but because I don’t fully grasp some of the basics, troubleshooting becomes much harder. I want to work on strengthening my foundational knowledge so that I can approach coding challenges with more confidence and efficiency. Additionally, I need guidance on structuring my code better, so it's easier to read, debug, and improve in future projects.
